## üåê Overview

This repository houses the foundational codebase for the **ERES PlayNAC KERNEL**, an intelligent, voice-controlled civic simulation engine designed by Joseph A. Sprute and the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics.

The system integrates:
- **EP √ó GERP + BEE** economic intelligence
- **CARE** (Choice, Action, Response, Evaluation) for human-centric decision making
- **SOMT-GEAR** for global state tracking and sustainability auditing
- **BioPoW**: Bioenergetic Proof-of-Work based on EEG entropy
- **EarnedPath**: Civic learning and contribution framework
- **VERTECA**: Hands-Free Voice Navigation (4D VR Ship's Computer)
- **JAS Graph**: Decentralized Task Consensus
- **Vacationomics**: Work-leisure balance rooted in nature's Golden Ratio (0.618)

## üõ† Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `playnac_kernel.py` | Main orchestrator: media tasks, mining, blockchain |
| `bio_pow.py` | EEG entropy-based proof-of-work engine |
| `media_kernel.py` | GERP visual transformations and MD complexity validation |
| `care_module.py` | CARE scoring logic for Water, Immigration, Security |
| `somt_recorder.py` | Logs system state for Solid-State Sustainability |
| `geo_perspective.py` | Encodes `GO<O>D` ‚Äî geographic-spiritual alignment |
| `jas_graph.py` | JAS Link-based task consensus and validation |
| `voice_nav_module.py` | VERTECA speech recognition for civic intent routing |
| `kernel_router.py` | Intent dispatcher for GERP, PlayNAC, EarnedPath |
| `4d_visual_env.py` | Web-based simulation interface using Three.js |
| `main_ship_ai.py` | Continuous loop for voice-controlled Ship's Computer |

## üîÑ System Workflow

1. **User speaks a civic command** (e.g., "show water usage")
2. **Voice is processed** by `voice_nav_module.py`
3. **Intent is routed** via `kernel_router.py`
4. **Module executes**, triggering `CARE`, `GERP`, or `EarnedPath`
5. **Media state is processed** and **bioentropy validated** via `BioPoW`
6. **Task is recorded** on blockchain with `JASConsensus`
7. **State is logged** via `SOMT-GEAR` and visualized in `4d_visual_env.py`

## üé§ Sample VERTECA Commands

- "Start game" ‚Üí Launches PlayNAC civic simulation
- "Learn path" ‚Üí Opens EarnedPath training modules
- "Show water" ‚Üí Fetches water metrics from GERP
- "Record state" ‚Üí Logs CARE state into SOMT
- "What is CARE?" ‚Üí Returns system description
